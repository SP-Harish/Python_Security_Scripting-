# Python_Security_Scripting-
Bunch of python scripts that can be used to enumerate and gain access.
All the scripts are purely dependent upon python libraries; thus making it cross platform.

Before Executing:

1.Read the comments withn the code file to understand the working of each scripts.
2. Hardcode the input within the code depending upon your environment.
3. execute using python2 from the commandline.

To improve the attack:
1. Try various social engineering techniques. Eg.,
  >converting each script into executable depending on the target OS using pyinstaller.
    +Before converting .py -> .exe.  Make sure all the libraries used in the respective .py file is installed in the OS interpreter that is present.
    Because all the file dependencies needs to be wrapped along with the .exe. Hence, making the .exe file executable irrespective of the python interpreter present in
    the target system.
  >Integrating with other files(image,pdf) using stegnography.
  
2.Modifying the scripts by analysing the various firewalls and evading them.
  
Tip:
You are limited only by your imagination.
